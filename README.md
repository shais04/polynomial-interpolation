# polynomial-interpolation
Finds the interpolating polynomial of least degree that goes through a set of points given as input. An example usage with the points `(1, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 6)` given as input yields the following:

```
Provide points as input in the form x,y.
You must provide at least one point.
All points must have a unique x-coordinate.
To end entry of points, simply leave the field blank.

Give a point: 1, 1
Give a point: 2, 3
Give a point: 3, 6
Give a point: 

Equation of the interpolating polynomial (up to 3 decimal places per coefficient):
y = 0.5x^2 + 0.5x^1 + 0.0
Answer using "Y" or "N" for "yes" and "no", respectively:
Show a graph of the polynomial with your points? n
